            FEES AND PAYMENTS
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The billing process will be under the control of GGES who shall send
            an invoice (on demand) as soon as the Client has agreed on a tuition
            session or series of tuition sessions unless alternate arrangements
            have been mutually agreed upon. 100% payment must be made to GGES to
            confirm the agreement before the session/s starts.

            please note that No refunds will be issued if you cancel your
            account after your first tutoring session. Refunds requests will be

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">SCHEDULING</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We strongly believe in On-Time deliverables and thus make sure to
            provide all our services on time. But we do understand that some
            circumstances may be beyond human control. So we are flexible too.
            In case client needs a rescheduling then he is expected to update
            GGES by mail at{" "}
            <span className="text-blue-600">info@mygges.com </span> at least 12
            hours before. In any urgent scenario we can accommodate any change
            in rescheduling only twice in 30 days. Failing aforesaid we will
            consider the scheduled session to be a Missed Session and that will
            be counted as a session. Vice versa at times you may not always get
            a tutoring session at your preferred time because of
            non-availability of tutors or due to other technological/operational
            issues. So GGES may communicate the reason of non-availability of
            your session to you either by email, phone, or any other means and
            reschedule that session at your any other preferred time.
